# Vivide Tree Widget
- Descents are configurable via a script
- The vivide view recognizes children
- 2 levels are done
- The tree gives visual feedback on whether a node is expanded

# Scripts
- Scripts have quite a complex call hierarchy
    - Script editor hands name to script step editor which resolves the name and sends it to vivide.js
    - vivide.js calls the script
- Currently scripts are evaluated in the vivide view 
    - Lazy loading in widgets not possible at the moment
    - Alternatives:
        - Widgets provide a callback
        - View hands down a function to the widgets
- The vivide view should store an already used script via this.getJSONAttribute()
