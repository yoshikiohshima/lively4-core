# Comparing Cell-based Documents To References
## Jupyter

- Jupyter as a system is similar to Lively4
  - Has: filebrowser, editor
  - Additionally provides: a console, overview over running processes
- Provides a cell-based live editing editor for code and markdown
- Lively4 is missing the live code editing

## Observable

- Focuses on live code editing
- Provides many connected objects and propagates changes to them
- [Plotting example](https://beta.observablehq.com/@mbostock/five-minute-introduction) is very similar to VivideJS
- Are we able to develop a VivideList like tool that parses code to show results?
  - Marcel already explained that code can be the input of a data sink to analyse it
  - The data sink could also execute the code

# Questions

- Is the convention for the index file ".md" or ".html"?  
  (index.html when)
- Is there a global function that allows to reference files here? (The function should open the file in an editor on click)
- Do we have a github markdown like checkbox?

# Vivide Documentation

- Main class: VivideView
  - Connects with other VivideView objects
  - Provides a data selection and corresponding events
  - Handles drag behavior
  - Maintains a widget
- Widget classes
  - E.g. VivideListWidget, VivideBoxplotWidget, VivideTextWidget
  - Provides description to display the data
