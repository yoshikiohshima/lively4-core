# Material Point Method Update

#### [Material point method: basics and applications](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vinh_Phu_Nguyen/publication/262415477_Material_point_method_basics_and_applications/links/00463537ab99f084f0000000/Material-point-method-basics-and-applications.pdf)

- Is a particle-in-cell (PIC) method
- Assumes that the whole mass of a material subdomain is concentrated in the corresponding material points
- **Two** methods: node to particle and particle to node (page 8), *main difference*: way the velocity gets updated
  - Node to particle moves the nodes not explicitly, because they are discarded anyway
  - Node to particle is more popular in FEM (Finite Element Method)
  - Node to particle can lead to infinite velocity for small masses
  - Particle to node solves the problem by using another equation
- Provides some basic implementation (c.f. page 19)
  - First example: single vibrating material (~ 50 LoC)
  - Second example: Vibration of a continuum bar
  - Third example: Impact of two elastic bodies
  - Fourth example:

#### [Material Point Method based Fluid Simulation on GPU using Compute Shader](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dody_Dharma2/publication/319525082_Material_Point_Method_based_Fluid_Simulation_on_GPU_using_Compute_Shader/links/59b0ca69458515a5b484e9b0/Material-Point-Method-based-Fluid-Simulation-on-GPU-using-Compute-Shader.pdf)

- Normally large number of particles
- Compute shader can improve the performance
- **Problem**: MPM requires serialized code to update values of the grid nodes and particles

# Feedback

- [x] Going to page 1 on a slide and backwards to the title slide shows a 0 as page number

# Questions

- [x] Is there something like "Close All Open Windows"?
- [x] How to show a presentation in fullscreen?
- [x] Do we have any markdown math plugins?
- [x] What do I have to do to make an external source clickable (possibly with target=_blank)
- [x] Stefan: Would it be interesting to connect both projects for demo (Show positions or velocity while particles move)?
